    <h2>"If shelters are looking to have more success, last year makes the case for reduced intake." - Marie Abbondanza, Shelter Animals Count</h2>
    <p>
      During the onset of the pandemic’s recovery, headlines about pet owners returning their beloved animals back to shelters caused a frenzy. But recent data doesn’t support that trend. In fact, shelters are following normal pre-pandemic trends this year and that is partially accredited to lower rates of intake. Shelters that use their resources to care for fewer animals are seeing higher success and steady adoption rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shelter Animals Count, a nonprofit organization that produces The National Database of shelter animal statistics, released their COVID-19 Impact Report last month. The report compares data from the first six months (Jan. to June) of the last three years: 2019, 2020, and 2021. The Report represents data collected from 341 shelter and rescue organizations as of July 12, 2021.
